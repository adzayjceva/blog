This week I wrote 2 test papers: on mathematical logic and on mathematical analysis. I also passed an oral exam in English and gave one of the last lectures on mathematical analysis on Friday. At the end of the week, I did the last laboratory and the last stage of the individual project. And after all that, I rested.
