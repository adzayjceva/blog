This week I read a lot, studied and did my homework on university subjects, just like last week. 
I celebrated my mother's birthday, made her a postcard for the first time in the format of a graphic file.
I discovered a lot of new things for myself from the book. It concerned the work of our brain, our beliefs and how they can be influenced.
