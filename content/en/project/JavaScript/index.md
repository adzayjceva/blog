JavaScript was originally created to "make web pages live."

Programs in this language are called scripts. They can be embedded in HTML and executed automatically when a web page loads.

Scripts are distributed and executed as plain text. They don't need special preparation or compilation to run.

This distinguishes JavaScript from another language – Java.

When JavaScript was created, it had a different name – "LiveScript". However, the Java language was very popular at the time, and it was decided that positioning JavaScript as the "younger brother" of Java would be useful.

Over time, JavaScript has become a completely independent language with its own specification, called ECMAScript, and now has nothing to do with Java.

Today JavaScript can be executed not only in the browser, but also on the server or on any other device that has a special program called the JavaScript "engine".

The browser has its own engine, which is sometimes called a "JavaScript virtual machine".
